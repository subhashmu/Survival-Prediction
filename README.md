# Survival-Prediction
The projects predicts the survival of passengers who embarked the RMS Titanic which started its voyage on April 10, 1912 using various Machine Learning Algorithm.

We will analyze the Titanic data set and make two predictions. One prediction to see which passengers on board the ship would survive and then another prediction to see if we wouldâ€™ve survived.

The data has been split into two groups:

1.training set (train.csv)
2.test set (test.csv)
