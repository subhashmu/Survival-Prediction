# Survival-Prediction
The projects predicts the survival of passengers who embarked the RMS Titanic which started its voyage on April 10, 1912 using various Machine Learning Algorithm.

We will analyze the Titanic data set and make two predictions. One prediction to see which passengers on board the ship would survive and then another prediction to see if we would’ve survived.

the projects consists of -

• Graphical representation of all independent factors showing their count of
  Survival.
  
• Preprocessing - Removed irrelevant variables, Null values, labeled the
  unlabeled variables and split the train and test set.
  
• Imported different Machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression,
  SVC (Linear Kernel), SVM(RBF), Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN,
  Gaussian NB and trained the model using them.
  
• Obtained 99.29 and 97.36 percent training accuracy with Decision Tree and
  Random Forest respectively and 84.61 percent test accuracy with the latter.
